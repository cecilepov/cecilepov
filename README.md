### Hello World, 

**Welcome to my Github!** ðŸŒ±


I am CÃ©cile, an engineer graduated from ESIEE Paris, a french engineering school where I majored in Computer Science.

My background is built around data processing, modeling and analysis, with a particular sensibility
to algorithms, memory management and problem modeling.

My fields of interest are:
- graph theory, network science
- algorithms
- research
- parallel computing
- data analysis

I am looking for an open-source project to contribute to, and more particularly a project linked to participatory science data analysis, ecology or biodiversity conservation. 

Feel free to contact me for project opportunities (or for a casual tech discussion! )
